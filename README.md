# Image Caption Generator with CNN & LSTM in Python

## Overview

This project implements an Image Caption Generator using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) in Python. The aim is to understand and apply the concepts of CNN and LSTM models to build a working image caption generator.

### Motivation

In this advanced Python project, we have developed a CNN-RNN model by building an image caption generator. The motivation behind this project includes:

- Exploring state-of-the-art techniques in computer vision and natural language processing.
- Understanding the synergy between CNNs and LSTMs for complex tasks such as image captioning.
- Addressing the need for innovative solutions in image understanding and content generation.

## Project Structure

1. **Source Code:**
   - `image_caption_generator.py`: Main script implementing the image caption generator.
   
2. **Data:**
   - *Image Dataset*: Directory containing the image dataset for training and testing.

3. **Dependencies:**
   - `requirements.txt`: List of Python dependencies needed to run the project.

4. **Model Checkpoints:**
   - Directory to store trained model checkpoints.

5. **Documentation:**
   - `README.md`: Overview of the project, instructions, usage details, and future works.

## How It Works

### CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks)

CNNs are employed to extract features from input images. The pre-trained Xception model, trained on the ImageNet dataset, is used for feature extraction. CNNs excel at identifying crucial features within images, making them suitable for image-related tasks.

### LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)

LSTM is utilized for generating captions based on the image features extracted by the CNN. LSTM, a type of recurrent neural network (RNN), is specifically designed for sequence prediction tasks. It effectively retains relevant information over long sequences and mitigates the issue of short-term memory associated with traditional RNNs.

### Image Caption Generation Process

1. **Feature Extraction:** Image features are extracted using the pre-trained CNN (Xception).
   
2. **Caption Generation:** These features are fed into the LSTM model, which processes them to generate descriptive captions for the images.

## Setup and Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/fictional-pancake.git
2. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
3. **Structure the Dataset**
4. **Run the program in terminal**
   ```bash
   py main.py -i example.jpg

### Important Notes

Model Performance: This CNN-RNN model is trained on a small dataset of 8000 images. As a result, its vocabulary is limited, and it may not predict words that are out of its vocabulary. For production-level models, training on larger datasets, typically exceeding 100,000 images, is recommended to achieve better accuracy.

### Future Works

Some potential areas for future improvement and exploration include:
- Data Augmentation: Implementing techniques such as data augmentation to increase the diversity of the training dataset.
- Fine-Tuning: Fine-tuning the pre-trained CNN model on domain-specific datasets to improve feature extraction for specific tasks.
- Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimizing model hyperparameters to enhance performance and generalization.
- Ensemble Methods: Exploring ensemble methods to combine multiple models for improved accuracy and robustness.

### Conclusion
The Image Caption Generator project showcases the synergy between Convolutional Neural Networks and Long Short-Term Memory networks in generating descriptive captions for images. By leveraging pre-trained CNN models for feature extraction and LSTM for sequence generation, the model can accurately describe the content of images, opening avenues for applications in image understanding, accessibility, and content generation.
